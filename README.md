For initial deployments run and after server restarts:

    $ ./initial_deployment.sh

This shell script will run a number of commands to set up the server. After this
is run, the code is built and the server is started with this command:

    $ ./start.sh

To set up auth, use letsencrypt and save the .pem files generated by letsencrypt 
in the /auth directory.

```
auth/
  -cert.pem
  -chain.pem
  -privkey.pem
```
